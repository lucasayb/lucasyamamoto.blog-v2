Nowadays, many companies that make their own website to enter the web decide not to give up their ERP. For cases like this, it is necessary to develop an integration, a micro application with the responsibility of allowing the web system to "talk" with the company's own application. In our trajectory at Codeby, we managed to get many mistakes and successes, and we came to bring them here to show you, possibly, the “formula” of integration. Check out!

## 1. Test the initial application data

Before starting any part of the project, do tests. Tools like Postman are just for that. Make all requests possible. This is done so that we can find out how the data will arrive for our developed micro application. Believe me, each test request can be responsible for completely changing the direction of the integration that is being developed, and also helps us to identify errors that may not be in our software.

## 2. Test target application data

The idea is to check how the information should be sent to the final system. This helps us to study what transformations will be necessary in the data of the initial system so that it fits its destiny.

## 3. Planning is essential

After testing, it's time to get your hands dirty. As obvious as this may seem, this is where the development of integration can be compromised. There are situations where both the initial system and the target software have flaws. And it is in these cases that the planning of the micro application must consider both ends of the communication and be impeccable. A bad projection leads to a longer process in the development of the integration and constant corrections that could have been avoided in this step. Make flowcharts, chat with the customer, don't worry about wasting time here. The more time lost in preparing your software, the more time you will gain in development itself and the more mature it will become. Excellent tools such as Draw.io are there to help you, however, although the programmer works daily with a computer, he should never get rid of pen and paper.

## 4. Focus on the functional

The task must be simple and straightforward: to integrate. Any features such as administrative panels for viewing information from this communication should come as an add-on. This is a feature in the project that, as cool and important as it is, is not essential for the basic functioning of the proposal. Of course, the client may demand something like that, but never waste time on a task that can be done in a short time when the core is not finished yet.

## 5. Research, and a lot!

It is possible and likely that one of the tools you are wasting more than 6 hours a day to develop has already been published on the internet. The developer community on the Web is huge, and there are many existing libraries to meet different needs. Don't reinvent the wheel, this could be a shot in the foot for both you and the customer.

## 6. Will the data be merged?

At this point you must decide where to end the data coming from the home system. Should they be merged into the final system? Should they simply be stored but separated with some specific attribute? This step does not depend only on the developer. The destination of the data must be studied together with the client, raising the pros and cons of each possibility.

## 7. Integration will never be perfect

Despite the name of the article talking about seamless integration, this is unfortunately a myth. Every application is subject to exceptions. The developer's role in the planning process to the effective completion of any type of system is, in addition to building it, to find as many exceptions as possible. However, the biggest difficulty in this process is that we do not have control over all possibilities of reaction of a software.

For this, there are several frameworks or robots developed to find a large number of possible exceptions that prevent the proper functioning of the software.

Finally, the perfect integration is the one that works and has the objective achieved. As much as your client is a large company, developing systems integration should not be a huge task. It can be complicated, with ups and downs and at worst a functional integration, but with great difficulties for maintenance. However, always seek to reach your final objective and never lose transparency in front of the client.
